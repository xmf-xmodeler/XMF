 *    An object has slots that are usually thought of as properties. The      *
 *    slots of an object are defined by the attributes of its class. Therefore*
 *    all objects of the same type have the same slots. Occasionally, it is   *
 *    desirable to have objects of the same type with different properties.   *
 *    The class ObjectWithProperties defines some simple features that        *
 *    support individual object-based properties.                             *
 *                                                                            *
 *    Note that you can achieve the same effect by managing the underlying    *
 *    slot storage of an object yourself. By doing so you are running against *
 *    the grain of the XMF and XOCL underlying semantics.                     *
 *                                                                            *
