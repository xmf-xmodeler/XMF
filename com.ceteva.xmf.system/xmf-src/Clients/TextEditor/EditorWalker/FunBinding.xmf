 *  An editor walker is assigned to each text editor showing an XMF file and  *
 *  is used to process the abstract syntax structure (a compilation unit)     *
 *  contained in the file. The walker generates commands to the text editor   *
 *  client in order to inform it of markup for the text. For example the      *
 *  walker detects unbound variables in the source code and uses the position *
 *  information contained in the abstract syntax structure to inform the      *
 *  editor where to place visual indicators of the error. The walker will be  *
 *  called as required by the text editor client: at most it may be called    *
 *  every time the text changes, but it is likely that there could be a delay *
 *  in order to make the processing more efficient.                           *
 *                                                                            *
