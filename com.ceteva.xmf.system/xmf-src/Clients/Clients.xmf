       This package contains definitions relating to XMF clients.
       An XMF client is a (possibly external) program that communicates
       with the XMF engine. Clients have command interpreters used to transmit
       messages to the Java client and receives events sent by the Java
       client. An XMF client uses a thread to read the 
       communication channel from the Java client.
