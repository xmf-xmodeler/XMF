\chapter{Semantics}\label{semanticschapter}\section{Introduction}The purpose of this chapter is to describe how the semantics ofmodelling and programming languages can be described usingmetamodels. The semantics of a modelling language describes whatthe language means in terms of its behaviour, static properties ortranslation to another a language. The chapter begins bymotivating the need for semantics and then describes a number ofdifferent approaches to defining semantics using metamodels. Theseapproaches aim to provide a way of constructing platformindependent models of semantics - thus enabling the semantics of alanguage to be interchanged between metamodelling tools.  Anexample of how the approaches can be used to define the semanticsof the StateMachine language is then presented.\section{What is Semantics?}In general terms, a language semantics describes the {\em meaning}of concepts in a language. When using a language, we need toassign a meaning to the concepts in the language if we are tounderstand how to use it. For example, in the context of amodelling language, our understanding of the meaning of aStateMachine or the meaning of a Class will form a key part of howwe choose to use them to model a specific aspect of a problemdomain.There are many ways of describing meaning of a language concept.Consider the ways in which the meaning of concepts in naturallanguages can be described:\begin{itemize}\item In terms of concepts which already have a well definedmeaning. For instance "a car consists of a chassis, four wheels,an engine, body, and so on". This is only meaningful if theconcepts themselves are well defined. \item By describing theproperties and behaviour of the concept: "a car can be stationary,or can be moving, and pressing the accelerator increases itsspeed". \item As a specialisation of another concept. Forinstance, "a truck is a vehicle with a trailer". \item Bydescribing the commonly shared properies of all possible instancesof a concept. For example, the concept of a car could be describedin terms of the valid properties that every instance of a carshould have.\end{itemize}In a natural language, semantics is a correlation or mappingbetween concepts in a language with thoughts and experiences ofconcepts in world around us. Although a more formal approach tosemantics is required for modelling and programming languages,there is a close parallel to the approaches used to expressnatural language semantics described above. In both cases, a keyrequirement of a semantics is that it should be of practical usein understanding the meaning of a language.\section{Why Semantics?}A semantics is essential to communicate the meaning of models orprograms to stakeholders in the development process. Semanticshave a central role to play in defining the semantically richlanguage capabilities such as execution, analysis andtransformation that are required to support Language-DrivenDevelopment. For example, a language that supports behaviour, suchas a StateMachine, requires a semantics in order to describe howmodels or programs written in the language execute.Traditionally, the semantics of many modelling languages aredescribed in an informal manner, either through natural languagedescriptions or examples. For instance, much of the UML 1.Xspecification \cite{umlspec} makes use of natural languagedescriptions of semantics.However, an informal semantics brings with it some significant problems:\begin{itemize}\item Because users have to assign an informal or intuitivemeaning to models, there is significant risk of misinterpretationand therefore misuse by the users of the modelling language.\item An informal semantics cannot be interpreted or understood by tools. Toolbuilders are thus required to implement their own interpretationof the semantics. Unfortunately, this means that the same languageis likely to be implemented in different ways. Thus, two differenttools may offer contradictory implementations of the samesemantics, e.g. the same StateMachine may execute differentlydepending on the tool being used!\item An informal semantics makes the task of defining newlanguages difficult. It  makes it hard to identify areas whereconcepts in the languages are semantically equivalent or wherethere are contradictions. It is harder still to extend an existinglanguage if the semantics of the language are not defined.\item Standards require precise semantics. Without them, astandard is open to misunderstanding and misuse by practitionersand tool developers while significantly limiting interoperablity.\end{itemize}\section{Semantics and Metamodels}While it is clear that semantics is crucial part of a languagedefinition, the question is how should semantics be described? Oneapproach is to express semantics in terms of a formal,mathematical language. Many academic papers have been writtendescribing the semantics of modelling languages in this way. Yet,the complex mathematical descriptions that result are hard tounderstand and are of limited practical use. Another approach isto express semantics in terms of an external programming language.This is a far more practical solution. Nevertheless, it results ina definition which is tied to a specific programming language thuscompromising its platform independence. Furthermore, being forcedto step out of the metamodelling environment into a programminglanguage makes for a very non-intuitive language definitionprocess.An alternative strategy is to describe the semantics of languagesusing metamodels. There are some significant benefits to thisapproach. Firstly, the semantics of a language is fully integratedin the language's definition, which means the task of relating itto other language design artifacts (concrete syntax, mappings,abstract syntax, etc) is immediately simplified. Secondly, becausethe same metamodelling language is used across all languages,semantic definitions become reusable assets that can be integratedand extended with relative ease. Finally, and most crucially,semantics definitions are platform independent - they can beinterchanged in the same way, and if they are understood by thetool that imports them, they can be used to drive the way that thetool interacts with the language. For instance, a semantics thatdescribes how a StateMachine executes can be used to drivesimulators across a suite of compliant tools. The ability todefine semantics in a platform independent way is crucial to thesuccess of Language-Driven Development. It enables tools to beconstructed for languages that are both portable and interoperableirrespective of the environment in which they are defined.It is important to note that a metamodel semantics is quitedifferent  from the abstract syntax model of a language, whichdefines the structure of the language. However, an abstract syntaxmodel is a pre-requisite for defining a semantics, as a semanticsadds a layer of meaning to the concepts defined in the abstractsyntax. Semantics in this sense should also be distinguished fromstatic semantics, which are the rules which dictate whether or notan expression of the language is well-formed. Static semanticsrules are those employed by tools such as type checkers.\section{Approaches}There are many different approaches to describing the semantics oflanguages in a metamodel. This section examines some keyapproaches and gives examples of their application. All theapproaches are motivated by approaches to defining semantics thathave widely been applied in programming language domains. The maindifference is that metamodels are used to express the semanticdefinitions.The approaches include:\begin{description}\item [Translational] Translating from concepts in one languageinto concepts in another language that have a precise semantics.\item [Operational] Modelling the operational behaviour oflanguage concepts. \item [Extensional] Extending the semantics ofexisting language concepts.\item [Denotational] Modelling themapping to semantic domain concepts.\end{description}Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. Inpractice, a combination of approaches is typically used, based onthe nature of individual concepts in the language. In each case,it is important to note that the semantics are described in themetamodelling language - no external formal representation isused. The following sections describe each of the approaches,along with a small example of their application.\section{Translational Semantics}Translational semantics is based on two notions:\begin{itemize}\item The semantics of a language is defined when the language istranslated into another form, called the target language. \itemThe target language can be defined by a small number of primitiveconstructs that have a well defined semantics.\end{itemize}The intention of the translational approach is to define themeaning  of a language in terms of primitive concepts that havetheir own well defined semantics. Typically, these primitiveconcepts will have an operational semantics (see later).The advantage of the translational approach is that provided therethere is a machine that can execute the target language, it ispossible to directly obtain an executable semantics for thelanguage via the translation. This approach is closely related tothe role played by a compiler in implementing a richer programminglanguage in terms of more primitive executable primitives.The main disadvantage of the approach is that information is lostduring the transformation process. While the end result is acollection of primitives, it will not be obvious how they arerelated to the original modelling language concepts. There areways to avoid this, for instance information about the originallanguage concepts can be "tagged" onto the target language, thusenabling it to retain information about the structure of theoriginal language. Alternatively, one may consider maintaininginformation about the mapping between the two models.The translational approach can be incorporated in a languagedefinition in many different ways:\begin{itemize}\item Within a language metamodel by translating one concept intoa concept that has a semantics, e.g. translating a case statementinto a sequence of if statements, where the if statements have anoperational semantics. Another example might be translating a richmapping language into a collection of primitive mapping functionswith additional information tagged onto the primitives to indicatethe structure of the source language. \item Between languagemetamodels, by translating one metamodel into another. Forexample, an abstract syntax metamodel for UML can be mapped to ametamodel of a small well-defined language such as XCore, or to aprogramming language such as Java.\end{itemize}\subsection{Approaches}There are a number of different approaches to implementing atransformational semantics in XMF:\begin{itemize}\item A mapping can be defined between the abstract syntax of thesource and target languages. This could be written in a mappinglanguage (such as XMap), or implemented by appropriate operationson the source model. \item The result of parsing the concretesyntax of the source language can be used to directly create aninstance of the target language. \item The result of parsing theconcrete syntax can be translated directly into machine code thatcan be run on the XMF virtual machine.\end{itemize}In the second approach, the intermediate step of generating anabstract syntax model for the source language can be omitted. Theconcrete syntax of the source language thus acts as {\em sugar}for the target language. This approach is particularly useful whenconstructing new types of expressions that can be desugared into anumber of more primitive concepts, e.g. translating a casestatement into a collection of if expressions.The third approach requires the construction of machine codestatements but has the advantage of resulting in a highlyefficient implementation.\subsection{Example}Because XMF provides a number of well defined primitives, it is agood target for translation. As an example, consider defining asemantics for StateMachines via a translation from theStateMachine abstract syntax model (described in chapter\ref{abschapter}). The mapping language used in this example isdescribed in detail in chapter \ref{mappingchapter}.  A summary ofthe approach taken is shown in figure \ref{translationExample}.\begin{figure}[htb]\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=14cm]{Semantics/figures/translational.pdf}\caption{Overview of the translational mapping example}\label{translationExample}\end{center}\end{figure}The aim is to translate a StateMachine into an instance of a XCoreClass such that semantics of the StateMachine is preserved. Thisis achieved by ensuring that the Class simulates the behaviour ofthe StateMachine:\begin{itemize}\item The StateMachine is translated into a Class containing anattribute called {\em state}, whose permitted values are theenumerated state names of the StateMachine.\item The Class will inherit all the attributes and operationsof the StateMachine's context class.\item Each transition of the StateMachine is translatedinto an operation of the Class with the same name as thetransition's event.\item The transition will contain code that will simulate theinvocation of the transition's guard and actions, causing the valueof {\em state} to change.\end{itemize}\noindent The following pattern of code will thus be required inthe body of each operation:\begin{lstlisting}  if <guard> then    self.state := <target-state-name>;    <action>  end\end{lstlisting}Where $<$guard$>$ and $<$action$>$ are the bodies of thecorresponding transition's guard and action, and$<$target-state-name$>$ is the name of the state that is the targetof the transition.The most challenging part of this translation is creating theappropriate code bodies in each operation. The following codeshows how XOCL can be used to define an operation, transitionOp(),which given the guard, action, event name and target name of atransition, returns an XCore operation that simulates thetransition. This operation is called by the transition2Op mapping.Note that in the operation transitionOp() an operation cannot beassigned a name until it is declared, thus setName() is used toassign it a name after it has been declared.\begin{lstlisting}@Map Transition2Op  @Operation  transitionOp(g:Operation,a:Operation,eventName,targetName)    let op = @Operation()      if g() then        a();        self.state := targetName      end    end    in      op.setName(eventName);      op    end  end  @Clause Transition2Op    Transition      [event = Set{        Event          [name = N]        },       name = T,       guard = G,       action = A]    do      self.transitionOp(G,A,N,T.name)  endend\end{lstlisting}This definition of transitionOp() makes use of the fact that inXMF an Operation is also an Object and can therefore be assignedto a variable.As an example, consider the simple traffic light model shown infigure \ref{trafficlight}. The result of applying theTransition2Op mapping to the GreenRed() transition will be thefollowing XOCL operation:\begin{figure}[htb]\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=11cm]{Semantics/figures/trafficlight.pdf}\caption{The traffic light example} \label{trafficlight}\end{center}\end{figure}\begin{lstlisting}@Operation GreenRed()  if g() then    a();    self.state := "Red"  endend\end{lstlisting}\noindent where g and a are the following anonymous operationdefinitions:\begin{lstlisting}@Operation anonymous() self.count < 10end@Operation anonymous()  self.count := self.count + 1end\end{lstlisting}\section{Operational Semantics}An operational semantics describes how models or programs writtenin a language can be directly executed. This involves constructingan interpreter. For example, an assignment statement “V := E” canbe described by an interpreter that executes the steps that itperforms: Evaluate the expression E and then change the valuebound to the variable V to be the result.The advantage of an operational semantics is that it is expressedin terms of operations on the language itself. In contrast, atranslational semantics is defined in terms of another, possiblyvery different, language. As a result, an operational semanticscan be easier to understand and write.Writing an interpreter as part of a metamodel relies on themetamodelling language itself being executable. Provided this isthe case, concepts can define operations that capture theiroperational behaviour.Typically, the definition of an interpreter for a language followsa pattern in which concepts are associated with an operationaldescription as follows:\begin{itemize}\item Operations will be defined on concepts that implement theiroperational semantics e.g. an action may have an run() operationthat causes a state change, while an expression may have an eval()operation that will evaluate the expression. \item The operationstypically take an environment as a parameter: a collection ofvariable bindings which will be used in the evaluation of theconcepts behaviour, and a target object, which will be the objectthat is changed as a result of the action or which represents thecontext of the evaluation. \item The operations will return theresult of the evaluation (a boolean in the case of a staticexpression) or change the value of the target object (in the caseof an action).\end{itemize}\subsection{Example}A StateMachine can be given an operational semantics by definingan interpreter that executes a StateMachine. It is implemented byconstructing a run() operation for the StateMachine class. We alsoadd an attribute messages, which records the messages that arepending on the StateMachine as a result of a send action on atransition:\begin{figure}[htb]\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=15cm]{Semantics/figures/messages.pdf}\caption{StateMachine model extended with message queues}\label{messages}\end{center}\end{figure}\noindent The code that executes the run() operation is below.More details about the executable language used here, and the useof executability as a means of defining semantics, will beexplained in chapter \ref{execChapter}.\begin{lstlisting}@Operation run(element)      let state = self.startingState() in        @While state <> null do          let result = state.activate(element) then            transitions = self.transitionsFrom(state) then            enabledTransitions = transitions->select(t |            t.isEnabled(element,result) and            if t.event <> null then              messages->head().name = t.event.name            else              true            end) in              if enabledTransitions->isEmpty then                state := null              else              let transition = enabledTransitions->sel in                transition.activate(element,result + self.messages->head().args.value);                state := transition.target();                if transition.event <> null then                  self.messages := self.messages->tail()                end              end            end          end        end      end    end\end{lstlisting}The operation takes the element that the StateMachine is beingapplied to. It first sets the state to be the starting state,then enters a while loop. Provided that the StateMachine has notterminated (state $<>$ null) the following is peformed:\begin{enumerate}\item The entry action on the current state is invoked by callingits activate operation. \item The collection of enabledtransitions is determined by selecting all the transitions thatleave the current state such that the evaluation of their guard istrue, and that an event is waiting on the machine that correspondsto the event on the transition. \item If there are no enabledtransitions, the state is set to null, and the run() operationterminates. \item If there are enabled transitions, one of them ischosen and its action is invoked, before assigning the state to bethe target of the transition.\end{enumerate}Consider the traffic light example shown in figure\ref{trafficlight}. If the current state of the StateMachine isGreen, then the above semantics ensures that the guard on theGreenRed() transition will be evaluated and if it returns true theaction on transition will be executed.As this example shows, complex behaviour can be captured in termsof operational definitions. Moreover, the definition canimmediately be tested and used within a tool to providesemantically rich means of validating and exercising models andprograms written in the language.\section{Extensional Semantics}In the extensional approach, the semantics of a language isdefined as an extension to another language. Modelling concepts inthe new language inherit their semantics from concepts in theother language. In addition, they may also extend the semantics,adding new capabilities for example.The benefit of the approach is that complex semantic concepts canbe reused with minimum effort. For example, a business entity neednot define what it means to create new instances, but can inheritthe capability from Class.The extensional approach has some commonality with the notion of aprofile (\cite{umlspec}). A profile provides a collection ofstereotypes, which can be viewed as sub-classes of UML or MOFmodel elements. However, by performing the extension at themetamodel level, greater expressibility is provided to the user,who can add arbitrarily rich semantic extensions to the newconcept. A suitable tool can make use of this information topermit the rapid implementation of new modelling languages. It mayrecognise that an extension has occurred, and use stereotypesymbols to tailor the symbols of the original modelling languageto support the new language (see section \ref{stereotypes}).\subsection{Example}As an example, consider the requirement to be able to createmultiple instances of the same StateMachine. This can be achievedby specialising the class Class from the XCore metamodel (seefigure \ref{extensionExample}. Because Class is instantiable, theStateMachine will also inherit its semantics.\begin{figure}[htb]\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=11cm]{Semantics/figures/extension.pdf}\caption{Example of extending the class Class}\label{extensionExample}\end{center}\end{figure}By specialising the class NamedElement a State can be owned by aStateMachine and can be navigated to via a pathname. Similarly, aTransition can owned by a StateMachine, but in this case it cannothave a name as it specialises the class Contained.While the extensional approach is appealing in terms of itssimplicity, it does have its disadvantages. Firstly, it istempting to try and 'shoe-horn' the complete semantics of alanguage into this form. In practice this is usually not possibleas there will be concepts that simply do not fit. In these cases,other approaches to defining semantics must be used.\section{Denotational Semantics}The purpose of denotational semantics is to associate mathematicalobjects, such as numbers, tuples, or functions, with each conceptof the language. The concept is/are said to {\em denote} themathematical object(s), and the object is called the {\emdenotation} of the concept. The objects associated with theconcept are said to be the {\em semantic domain} of the concept. Awidely used example of this in programming language semantics isthe denotation of the operation + by a number. For instance, thedenotation of 4+5 is 9.A denotational semantics can be thought of as semantics byexample. By providing all possible examples of a concept'smeaning, it is possible to define precisely what it means. In theabove example, there is only one denotation. However, manyconcepts are denoted by a collection of examples. To describe thesemantics of an Integer, the set of all positive numbers would berequired, i.e. the denotation of Integer is 0..infinity.Denotational descriptions of semantics tend to be static, i.e.they enumerate valid instances of a concepts, and a non-executablefashion.Here are some common examples of denotational relationships foundin metamodels:\begin{itemize}\item The denotation of a Class is the collection of all Objectsthat may be an instance of it. \item The denotation of an Actionis a collection of all possible state changes that can result fromits invocation. \item The denotation of an Expression is thecollection of all possible results that can be obtained fromevaluating the expression.\end{itemize}A denotational semantics can be defined in a metamodel byconstructing a model of the language's abstract syntax andsemantic domain and of the semantic mapping that relates them.Constraints are then written that describe when instances ofsemantic domain concepts are valid with respect to their abstractsyntax. For example, constraints can be written that state when anObject is a valid instance of a Class.The advantage of the denotational approach is its declarativenature. In particular, it captures semantics in a way that doesnot commit to a specific choice of operational semantics. Forinstance, while an operational semantics would have to describehow an expression is evaluated, a denotational semantics simplydescribes what the valid evaluation/s of the expression would be.In practice a purely denotational approach is best used when ahigh-level specification of semantics is required. It isparticularly useful in a standard where commitment to a specificimplementation is to be avoided. Because they provide aspecification of semantics they can be used to testimplementations of the standard: candidate instances generated byan implementation can be checked against the denotationalconstraints. A good example of the denotational semantics approachis the OCL 2.0 specification \cite{ocl2}, where they are used todescribe the semantics of OCL expressions.\subsection{Example}We can describe the execution semantics of a StateMachine bymodelling the semantic domain concepts that give it a meaning. Auseful way of identifying these concepts is to consider thevocabulary of concepts we would use to describe the behaviour of aStateMachine. This might include concepts such as a state change(caused by a transition), examples of statemachines in specificstates, and message queues.Figure \ref{sdExample} shows an example of a semantic domain thatmight result from generalising these concepts into a model.\begin{figure}[htb]\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=14cm]{Semantics/figures/semanticdomain.pdf}\caption{A semantic domain for StateMachines} \label{sdExample}\end{center}\end{figure}The denotation of a StateMachine is essentially a model of thevalid state changes that may occur to the StateMachine at anypoint in time. Here a StateMachineInstance is used to model aStateMachine at a specific point in time. It has a state, and asequence of messages which are waiting to be consumed by themachine. State changes represent the invocation of a transition,causing the StateMachine to move from one state (the before state)to another (the after state).Using this model, many different examples of valid StateMachinebehaviours can be tested. The snapshot in figure \ref{sdsnapshot}shows a fragment of the behaviour of a machine that has twotransitions from the state A to the state B and back again.\begin{figure}[htb]\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=13cm]{Semantics/figures/sdsnapshot.pdf}\caption{An example snapshot of a StateMachine's behaviour}\label{sdsnapshot}\end{center}\end{figure}In order to complete the model, the relationship between thesemantic domain and abstract syntax model must also be modelled.This relationship, commonly called a {\em semantic mapping}, iscrucial to defining the semantics of the language. It makesprecise the rules that say when instances of semantic domainconcepts are valid with respect to a abstract syntax model. Inthis case, when a particular sequence of state changes is validwith respect to a specific StateMachine.Figure \ref{semanticmapping} shows the semantic mapping model. AStateMachineInstance is associated with its StateMachine, while aStateChange and Message are associated with the Transition andEvent that they are instances of.\begin{figure}[htb]\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=8cm]{Semantics/figures/semanticmapping.pdf}\caption{Semantic mapping model for the StateMachine language}\label{semanticmapping}\end{center}\end{figure}Finally, well-formedness rules will be required. An example is therule which guarantees that the before and after states of aStateChange commutes with the source and target states of thetransition it is an instance of:\begin{lstlisting}context StateChange  self.transition.sourceName = self.before.state.name and  self.transition.targetName = self.after.state.name\end{lstlisting}Other rules will be required to ensure that the state changesassociated with a state machine are valid with respect to itsexecution semantics. These will describe such aspects as theconditions under which transitions are enabled, and the order inwhich they may fire.\section{Process}The choice of semantics depends on the type of language beingdefined. The following pointers provide a guide to choosing themost appropriate approach.\begin{itemize}\item If a declarative, non executable semantics is required, usethe denotational approach. \item If a language has concepts thatneed to be evaluated, executed or instantiated then they should bemodelled using an operational, translational or extensionalapproach. The choice of approach will be based on the following:  \begin{itemize}  \item If a concept is clearly a sugared form of more primitive  concepts, adopt a translation approach. This avoids having to  construct a semantics for the concept from scratch - reuse the  semantic machinery that has already been defined for the primitive  concepts. This approach should only be used when it is  acceptable to loose information about the original concept.  \item If information must be kept about the concept and it is  possible to reuse an existing concept use the extensional approach.  \item If there is no convenient means of reusing an existing  concept use the operational approach to construct an interpreter.  \end{itemize}\end{itemize}Note, there are no hard and fast rules to choosing an approach.The primary aim should be to develop a semantic model that meetsthe needs of the stakeholders of the language.\section{Conclusion}Semantics is crucial in being able to understand the meaning of amodelling language, to be able to interact with it a meaningfulway, and to be able to support truly interoperable languagedefinitions. This chapter has shown that a language semantics canbe successfully captured with a metamodel. The key advantages arethat the semantics becomes an integrated part of the languagedefinition while remaining understandable to users and modellingtools.
